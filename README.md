# UUIDFetcher-Cache
Combination of the two libs together along with an example.
The UUIDFetcher is made by evilmidget38.
The NameFetcher is also made by him.
The cache libary (that saves the information obtained from the UUIDFetcher for certain amount of hours) is made by Staartvin.

All the libs are made by them. Im just oragnising those projects and libs in one place, with an example included, and my best effort to update them as long as there is a need...

UUIDFetcher: https://gist.github.com/evilmidget38/26d70114b834f71fb3b4

Cache Libary (includes the uuidfetcher library): https://github.com/Armarr/Autorank-2/tree/master/src/me/armar/plugins/autorank/util/uuid

By the way, I am using diffrent package names than the authors to organize everything, I'm not trying to claim those pieces of code as mine!

Todo:

 - Correctly handle UUIDs and Player names that don't exsit in the mojang api.
